            <h3 class="title">how polution affects on turtles?</h3>
            <p>The sources of pollution include everything from fishing nets lost by fisherman to fertilizer runoff from farms to the wastewater discharged by cruise ships. Thus, even those who reside in the heart of the European Union can have an effect on the wellbeing of the seas and sea turtles.
                Numerous toxins build up in the tissues of sea turtles, compromising their ability to move, function normally in the brain, and reproduce. Thousands of chemicals pollute the marine environment. Additionally, plastics and other marine waste that are detrimental to sea turtles' digestive systems are consumed by them. The incidence and development of fibropapillomatosis, a condition that causes tumors to develop on the shells of sea turtles, is thought by scientists to be related to exposure to agricultural pollution.</p> 
                
            <h2>Plastics</h2>    

            <p>Each year, more than six million tons of trash enters the oceans, with plastics comprising up to 90 percent. Marine trash poses an entanglement and ingestion hazard to turtles, threatening their ability to forage, grow and, ultimately, survive. A study conducted on young loggerhead turtles found that 15 percent of the turtles had ingested large amounts of plastics that blocked their stomach from functioning.</p> 

            <h2>Invasive species</h2>
            <p>Invasive species are non-native species of plants, animals or insects that have been introduced into an area where they are not found naturally. They can wreak havoc on native species by competing them for space and food or by acting as predators.</p>
            
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Pollution can have several consequences on turtles, including:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Entanglement in plastic debris: Turtles are at risk of entanglement in plastic debris such as fishing nets, plastic bags, and six-pack rings. This can lead to injuries or even death.</li>
                <li>Ingestion of plastic: Turtles often mistake plastic debris for food, which can lead to blockages in their digestive system, starvation, or poisoning.</li>
                <li>Chemical pollution: Turtles can be exposed to chemical pollutants such as oil spills, agricultural chemicals, and heavy metals. These pollutants can harm turtles' health and cause reproductive problems, weakened immune systems, and developmental abnormalities.</li>
                <li>Habitat destruction: Pollution can also degrade the quality of turtles' habitats, such as their nesting beaches and feeding grounds. This can result in reduced nesting success, increased predation, and decreased food availability.</li>
                <li>Climate change: Pollution and other human activities contribute to climate change, which can affect turtles in various ways, including altering ocean currents, sea level rise, and increasing sea surface temperature. These changes can lead to changes in turtle migration patterns, nesting behavior, and survival rates.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">How to prevent ?</p>
            <p>

                Preventing pollution from affecting turtles requires a concerted effort from individuals, communities, and governments. Here are some ways to help protect turtles from pollution:
                
                 Reduce plastic use: Plastic is a major contributor to pollution in our oceans, and turtles are especially vulnerable to its effects. You can help reduce plastic pollution by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, and avoiding single-use plastics.
        
                 Properly dispose of waste: Make sure to properly dispose of your waste, and participate in community clean-up efforts. Avoid littering and dispose of hazardous waste, such as batteries and chemicals, properly.
        
                 Support conservation efforts: Many organizations work to protect turtle habitats and populations. You can support these efforts by volunteering, donating, or spreading awareness about turtle conservation.
        
                 Use eco-friendly products: Choose products that are eco-friendly and biodegradable, and avoid using products that contain harsh chemicals or pollutants.
        
                 Advocate for change: Governments and corporations have a major role to play in reducing pollution. You can advocate for policies and regulations that promote sustainable practices and reduce pollution. Contact your elected officials and encourage them to take action to protect turtles and their habitats.</p>
