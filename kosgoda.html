            <h3 class="title">KOSGODA TURTLE HATCHERY, GALLE, SRI LANKA</h3>
            <p>The turtles that lay their eggs on the Sri Lankan beaches are under threat because of human activity – and they have been for decades. But in more recent times, there have been some conservation efforts to try to address the crisis.
                One of these efforts is the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. It was started almost 40 years ago and is still going today.The eggs are then buried in a sandpit here and looked after until it’s time for them to hatch. Once they are hatched, they are kept in a tank for a few days and fed. Then the males are taken down the beach and released in the most natural way possible.Meanwhile, the females are kept at the centre and looked after for another five years before they’re released. It’s less common to get baby turtle females and the idea is that they are much more likely to survive this way.

                Along the stretch of Sri Lankan coast where the turtles come, there are now six hatcheries like this one. Every year, up to 400 turtles lay eggs here.
                
                A single hatchery could release up to about 7000 baby turtles in a year – although, just as in situations without human intervention, probably only about 5 per cent would survive.</p>
